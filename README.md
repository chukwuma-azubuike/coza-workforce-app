### FIX DEPENDENCY ISSUES

If you get an error pointing to the DatePicker library - react-native-community_datetimepicker, do this:

Go to: CozaGlobalWorkforceApp/node_modules/@react-native-community/datetimepicker/android/src/main/java/com/reactcommunity/rndatetimepicker/Common.java:76:

-   Add "final" just before the "@NonNull Context activityContext" to define the Class methods properly.
-   Run `yarn android` and it should work this time.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
